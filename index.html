# Step 0

Welcome back!

> This week we're going to start working with
**"multi-dimensional arrays"**.

We assume that you've finished all the way through Step 2 of the
Week 3 exercises. If you haven't finished that yet, feel free to
go back and finish that now, and we'll see you
when you're done.

## 1-Dimensional Arrays - review

We've already worked with 1D arrays: they're the variable type
that we've used when we want to represent "an ordered list of stuff".

An array has a `.length` property that lets us know how long the array
is, and we can use `[]` to access specific elements of the array
by their **0-based** index:

```
let x = [27, 3, 15, 1];

let y = x[1]; // 3

let numElementsBiggerThan10 = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    if (x[i] > 10) {
        numElementsBiggerThan10++;
    }
}
let z = numElementsBiggerThan10; // 2
```

## 1D Array Challenge

For the first challenge in `step_0.js`, we'll implement a method
that gets two different arrays of numbers (one short, one long).

For the short array:

* Add up all the elements and log the result
* Log the largest element

For the long array:

* _Efficiently_ find the 1001st element of the array and log the value

> **CHALLENGE**: to proceed, go ahead and update
`step_0.js` to `log()` the required values

# Step 1

Now let's talk about 2D arrays - arrays **of** arrays

## Can you put an array in an array?

We've said before that each element of an array can contain
a variable of any valid type:

```
let w = [1, 2, 7, 23]; // Array of numbers
let x = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']; // Array of strings
let y = [true, false, false]; // Array of booleans
let z = [null, null, null]; // Array of null values
```

But what about if we wanted to put **arrays** as the value
of each element of an array? This is not only possible,
but also really powerful:

```
let ticTacToeBoard = [
    ['X', '-', 'O'],
    ['X', 'O', '-'],
    ['X', '-', '-'],
];

let firstRow = ticTacToeBoard[0]; // ['X', '-', 'O']
let thirdRow = ticTacToeBoard[2]; // ['X', '-', '-']
```

So each element of the `ticTacToeBoard` array is an array,
and we can think of it as the **row** of a 2D grid.

And then each element of the row can be thought of as the
value for the **column** in that row.

## How many rows or columns?

Consider this example:

```
let myGrid = [
    [1, 2, 7],
    [9, 3, 5],
];

let numRows = myGrid.length; // 2
let numCols = myGrid[0].length; // 3
let middleFirstRow = myGrid[0][1]; // 2
```

The variable `myGrid`:

* Is an array containing arrays of numbers
* Has two elements in it (rows)
* Each row is an array containing 3 numbers

> **Check-in:** Why is `middleFirstRow` equal to `2` in the above example?
`myGrid[0]` is equal to the entire first row `[1, 2, 7]`, and then
the `[1]` at the end is grabbing the 2nd element of that row.

## Challenge Time

Ok, for the challenge for Step 1, we're going to implement a function
that will be given a grid of numbers:

* Log the number of rows / columns as a pair (e.g. `(5, 2)`)
* Log the value of the 2nd column, 1st row
* Log the sum of all the values in the 2nd row
* Log the sum of all the values in the 1st column
* Log the sum of the values in the 4 corners of the grid

Got all that? Awesome, let's get started!

# Step 2

Let's talk about how to check values **next to** a location in a 2D grid.

## Who is my neighbor?

Suppose that you have a 2D grid, representing something like a map,
and we have a (row, column) pair representing our location on the map:

```
let myMap = [
    ['-', '-', '-', 'x', 'T'],
    ['-', '-', '-', 'x', '-'],
    ['-', 'P', 'x', 'x', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
];

let currentLocation = [2, 1]; // Row = 2, Col = 1
```

And suppose the map uses:

* '-' to indicate a space where we cannot walk
* 'P' to indicate a space we've already been
* 'x' to indicate a space we could go (but haven't yet)
* 'T' to indicate treasure

Given this setup, let's ask an initial question:

> **Question:** what is the value of `myMap` corresponding
to the location `currentLocation`? We can fetch this with
`myMap[currentLocation[0]][currentLocation[1]]`, which in
this case would result in the value `'P'`

Now, suppose that we want to know where we're allowed to walk
next on the map. How can we check the option 1 space to the right?

> **Question:** how would we check the value of `myMap` that
is one space to the right of `currentLocation`? We would keep the
same row as `currentLocation`, and increase the column by 1:
`myMap[currentLocation[0]][currentLocation[1] + 1]`, which in
this case would result in the value `'x'`

Ok, so we have a good option to the right. What about moving
down from our current location?

> **Question:** how would we check the value of `myMap` that
is one space "down" from `currentLocation`? We would increase
the row by 1, and keep the column the same as `currentLocation`:
`myMap[currentLocation[0] + 1][currentLocation[1]]`, which in
this case would result in the value `'-'`

## Modifying values in a 2D array

Suppose that using the previous example with the map, we want to
move one step to the right:

```
let myMap = [
    ['-', '-', '-', 'x', 'T'],
    ['-', '-', '-', 'x', '-'],
    ['-', 'P', 'x', 'x', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
];

let originalLocation = [2, 1]; // Row = 2, Col = 1
let newLocation = [
    originalLocation[0],
    originalLocation[1] + 1
];  // Row = 2, Col = 2
```

But now, we want to update the map with a `'P'` to remember where
we've gone so far! How can we do that?

If we wanted to read the value at `(2,2)` on the map, we would just do:

```
let valueInCenter = myMap[2][2];
```

and it turns out the same syntax works the other way around for assigning
a new value:

```
// Mark our new location on the map
myMap[newLocation[0]][newLocation[1]] = 'P';

// New value of myMap:
// [
//     ['-', '-', '-', 'x', 'T'],
//     ['-', '-', '-', 'x', '-'],
//     ['-', 'P', 'P', 'x', '-'],
//     ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
//     ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
// ]
```

## What about when our neighbor doesn't exist?

With this example of searching up/down/left/right for neighbors on a map,
there's a situation where we can hit bugs. For example:

```
let myMap = [
    ['-', '-', '-', 'P', 'T'],
    ['-', '-', '-', 'P', '-'],
    ['-', 'P', 'P', 'P', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
    ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'],
];

let currentLocation = [0, 3]; // Row = 0, Col = 3
```

In this state, we're nearly to the treasure! So we look nearby to see
which of our neighbors might be the treasure, and maybe we start by looking
one space **above** our current location.

> **Question:** what goes wrong when we try to check the space above?
We would decrease the row by 1, meaning we would check row `-1`, which does
not exist!

The callout here is that as you check neighbors, you also have to verify
first that the (row, column) location you're about to check is within
the range of the grid! That means between `0` and `rows - 1` for the row (inclusive),
and between `0` and `cols - 1` for the column (inclusive).

## Challenge time

For the `step_2.js` challenge, you're going to be given a treasure map
like in the above examples, and given a starting location on that map.

**Your task** is to follow the `x` spaces on the map to the treasure,
and then log:

* How many steps it took
* The (row, column) location of the treasure
